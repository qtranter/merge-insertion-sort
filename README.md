# merge-insertion-sort

The files located in the src/resources folder show randomly generated numbers for 10 digits, 100, 1,000, 10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000.

The appropriately named merge/insert sort output files show those same randomly generated numbers ordered correctly.

It is possible to clone this repo and delete everything in the resources folder. Running either InsertionSort.java or MergeSort.java will generate new randomly generated numbers for the required digits from 10 to the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6th power.
